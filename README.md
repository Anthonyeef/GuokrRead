## 果壳精选 ₍₍ (ง ᐛ)ว ⁾⁾

Here is an unofficial Android application for 果壳精选.
** Still underbuilding **

Because the official application looks like the old 90's style, so I make this one -- with Material Design -- just for fun. Also in ther purpose of practising some new libraries.

- Fresco from Facebook
- Butterknife from Jake Wharthon

- OkHttp from Square
