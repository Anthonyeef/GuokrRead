## 果壳精选 ₍₍ (ง ᐛ)ว ⁾⁾

Here is an unofficial Android application for 果壳精选.

**Still underbuilding**

Because the official application looks like the old 90's style, so I make this one -- with Material Design -- just for fun. Also in ther purpose of practising some new libraries.

### Libraries I used
- Retrofit 2.0-beta from Square
- Fresco from Facebook
- Butterknife from Jake Wharthon
- GSON from Google
- OkHttp from Square


### Disclaimer
- The API I use for this application DOES NOT FROM Guokr's authorization. I tried to contact staff there but no more reply then. I got the API by myself using the software called Charles. This action should be think as incorrect and I would delete the code if anyone from Guokr ask me to.
- Though this section is named 'Disclaimer', I would take responsibility for this project.
 

### Intern wanted
If you like my work and still have a long time internship position in Beijing start from March, 2016, please feel free to contact me ;)
